# A-polynomial-regression-machin-learning-approach-for-reliability-based-optimization
This is a compact code for reliability analysis under uncertainty using a Polynomial Regression Machine Learning approach. The code implements a stochastic response surface method (SRSM) which quantifies the uncertainty in a performance function for the purpose of reliability-based design optimization (RBDO).
